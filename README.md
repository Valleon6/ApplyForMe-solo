#### Project Title: Apply for Me.

#### Description:

You work at a remote company, and you earn $1k a month. You are very happy. But you sometimes think - what if there are better jobs out there for me? But it's too much work to apply. In comes: ApplyForMe. A service where you tell us your skills and what you are looking for, and people apply for you for 100s of jobs. All you need to do is attend interviews.
